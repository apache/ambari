### Are you creating an issue in the correct repository?

- When in doubt, create an issue here.
- If you have an issue with the Jasmine docs, file an issue in the docs repo
  here: https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine.github.io
- This repository is for the core Jasmine framework
- If you are using a test runner that wraps Jasmine (Jasmine npm, karma, etc),
  consider filing an issue with that library if appropriate

### When submitting an issue, please answer the following:

 - What version are you using?
 - What environment are you running Jasmine in (node, browser, etc)?
 - How are you running Jasmine (standalone, npm, karma, etc)?
 - If possible, include an example spec that demonstrates your issue.

 Thanks for using Jasmine!
