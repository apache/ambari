Description:
helpers.js contains the helpers normally emitted by the TypeScript compiler
(seen in the above emitter.ts link) as support code, modified to work with
the Closure compiler.

When building using tsickle, we pass --noEmitHelpers to the TypeScript compiler
and use this module instead.

Local modifications:
- Adjusted code to be Closure compatible; e.g. added type annotations and
  avoided using the global Reflect as that triggers a bug in the Closure
  compiler's polyfill support.
