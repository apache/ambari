## Note

The CLI is now in 1.0.
If you are updating from a beta or RC version, check out our [1.0 Update Guide](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-1.0-update).

If you wish to collaborate, check out [our issue list](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues).

Before submitting new issues, have a look at [issues marked with the `type: faq` label](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22type%3A%20faq%22%20).

## Prerequisites

Both the CLI and generated project have dependencies that require Node 6.9.0 or higher, together
with NPM 3 or higher.

## Installation

**BEFORE YOU INSTALL:** please read the [prerequisites](#prerequisites)
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## Usage

```bash
ng help
```

### Generating and serving an Angular project via a development server

```bash
ng new PROJECT-NAME
cd PROJECT-NAME
ng serve
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

You can configure the default HTTP host and port used by the development server with two command-line options :

```bash
ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4201
```

### Generating Components, Directives, Pipes and Services

You can use the `ng generate` (or just `ng g`) command to generate Angular components:

```bash
ng generate component my-new-component
ng g component my-new-component # using the alias

# components support relative path generation
# if in the directory src/app/feature/ and you run
ng g component new-cmp
# your component will be generated in src/app/feature/new-cmp
# but if you were to run
ng g component ../newer-cmp
# your component will be generated in src/app/newer-cmp
# if in the directory src/app you can also run
ng g component feature/new-cmp
# and your component will be generated in src/app/feature/new-cmp
```
You can find all possible blueprints in the table below:

Scaffold  | Usage
---       | ---
[Component](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-component) | `ng g component my-new-component`
[Directive](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-directive) | `ng g directive my-new-directive`
[Pipe](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-pipe)           | `ng g pipe my-new-pipe`
[Service](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-service)     | `ng g service my-new-service`
[Class](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-class)         | `ng g class my-new-class`
[Guard](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-guard)         | `ng g guard my-new-guard`
[Interface](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-interface) | `ng g interface my-new-interface`
[Enum](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-enum)           | `ng g enum my-new-enum`
[Module](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-module)       | `ng g module my-module`




angular-cli will add reference to `components`, `directives` and `pipes` automatically in the `app.module.ts`. If you need to add this references to another custom module, follow this steps:
 
 1. `ng g module new-module` to create a new module
 2.  call `ng g component new-module/new-component`
 
This should add the new `component`, `directive` or `pipe` reference to the `new-module` you've created.
 
### Updating Angular CLI

If you're using Angular CLI `1.0.0-beta.28` or less, you need to uninstall `angular-cli` package. It should be done due to changing of package's name and scope from `angular-cli` to `@angular/cli`:
```bash
npm uninstall -g angular-cli
npm uninstall --save-dev angular-cli
```

To update Angular CLI to a new version, you must update both the global package and your project's local package.

Global package:
```bash
npm uninstall -g @angular/cli
npm cache clean
npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
```

Local project package:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules dist # use rmdir /S/Q node_modules dist in Windows Command Prompt; use rm -r -fo node_modules,dist in Windows PowerShell
npm install --save-dev @angular/cli@latest
npm install
```

If you are updating to 1.0 from a beta or RC version, check out our [1.0 Update Guide](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-1.0-update).

You can find more details about changes between versions in [the Releases tab on GitHub](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/releases).


## Development Hints for working on Angular CLI

### Working with master

```bash
git clone https://github.com/angular/angular-cli.git
cd angular-cli
npm link
```

`npm link` is very similar to `npm install -g` except that instead of downloading the package
from the repo, the just cloned `angular-cli/` folder becomes the global package.
Additionally, this repository publishes several packages and we use special logic to load all of them
on development setups.

Any changes to the files in the `angular-cli/` folder will immediately affect the global `@angular/cli` package,
allowing you to quickly test any changes you make to the cli project.

Now you can use `@angular/cli` via the command line:

```bash
ng new foo
cd foo
npm link @angular/cli
ng serve
```

`npm link @angular/cli` is needed because by default the globally installed `@angular/cli` just loads
the local `@angular/cli` from the project which was fetched remotely from npm.
`npm link @angular/cli` symlinks the global `@angular/cli` package to the local `@angular/cli` package.
Now the `angular-cli` you cloned before is in three places:
The folder you cloned it into, npm's folder where it stores global packages and the Angular CLI project you just created.

You can also use `ng new foo --link-cli` to automatically link the `@angular/cli` package.

Please read the official [npm-link documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link)
and the [npm-link cheatsheet](http://browsenpm.org/help#linkinganynpmpackagelocally) for more information.

To run the Angular CLI test suite use the `node tests/run_e2e.js` command.
It can also receive a filename to only run that test (e.g. `node tests/run_e2e.js tests/e2e/tests/build/dev-build.ts`).

As part of the test procedure, all packages will be built and linked.
You will need to re-run `npm link` to re-link the development Angular CLI environment after tests finish.
