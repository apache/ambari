/**
 * Conditionally includes a template based on the value of an `expression`.
 *
 * `ngIf` evaluates the `expression` and then renders the `then` or `else` template in its place
 * when expression is truthy or falsy respectively. Typically the:
 *  - `then` template is the inline template of `ngIf` unless bound to a different value.
 *  - `else` template is blank unless it is bound.
 *
 * ## Most common usage
 *
 * The most common usage of the `ngIf` directive is to conditionally show the inline template as
 * seen in this example:
 * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfSimple'}
 *
 * ## Showing an alternative template using `else`
 *
 * If it is necessary to display a template when the `expression` is falsy use the `else` template
 * binding as shown. Note that the `else` binding points to a `<ng-template>` labeled `#elseBlock`.
 * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view but is typically placed right after
 * `ngIf` for readability.
 *
 * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}
 *
 * ## Using non-inlined `then` template
 *
 * Usually the `then` template is the inlined template of the `ngIf`, but it can be changed using
 * a binding (just like `else`). Because `then` and `else` are bindings, the template references can
 * change at runtime as shown in this example.
 *
 * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}
 *
 * ## Storing conditional result in a variable
 *
 * A common pattern is that we need to show a set of properties from the same object. If the
 * object is undefined, then we have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to guard against
 * dereferencing a `null` value. This is especially the case when waiting on async data such as
 * when using the `async` pipe as shown in following example:
 *
 * ```
 * Hello {{ (userStream|async)?.last }}, {{ (userStream|async)?.first }}!
 * ```
 *
 * There are several inefficiencies in the above example:
 *  - We create multiple subscriptions on `userStream`. One for each `async` pipe, or two in the
 *    example above.
 *  - We cannot display an alternative screen while waiting for the data to arrive asynchronously.
 *  - We have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties, which is cumbersome.
 *  - We have to place the `async` pipe in parenthesis.
 *
 * A better way to do this is to use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local
 * variable as shown in the the example below:
 *
 * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}
 *
 * Notice that:
 *  - We use only one `async` pipe and hence only one subscription gets created.
 *  - `ngIf` stores the result of the `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.
 *  - The local `user` can then be bound repeatedly in a more efficient way.
 *  - No need to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties as `ngIf` will only
 *    display the data if `userStream` returns a value.
 *  - We can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.
 *
 * ### Syntax
 *
 * Simple form:
 * - `<div *ngIf="condition">...</div>`
 * - `<div template="ngIf condition">...</div>`
 * - `<ng-template [ngIf]="condition"><div>...</div></ng-template>`
 *
 * Form with an else block:
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition; else elseBlock">...</div>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * Form with a `then` and `else` block:
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock"></div>
 * <ng-template #thenBlock>...</ng-template>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * Form with storing the value locally:
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition as value; else elseBlock">{{value}}</div>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>
 * ```
