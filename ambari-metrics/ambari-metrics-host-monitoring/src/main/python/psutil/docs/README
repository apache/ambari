About
=====

This directory contains the reStructuredText (reST) sources to the psutil
documentation.  You don't need to build them yourself, prebuilt versions are
available at http://psutil.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.
In case you want, you need to install sphinx first:

    $ pip install sphinx

Then run:

    $ make html

You'll then have an HTML version of the doc at _build/html/index.html.
