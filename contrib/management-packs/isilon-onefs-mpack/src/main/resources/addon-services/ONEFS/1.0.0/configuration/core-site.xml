    <description>The mapping from kerberos principal names to local OS mapreduce.job.user.names.
  So the default rule is just "DEFAULT" which takes all principals in your default domain to their first component.
  "omalley@APACHE.ORG" and "omalley/admin@APACHE.ORG" to "omalley", if your default domain is APACHE.ORG.
The translations rules have 3 sections:
      base     filter    substitution
The base consists of a number that represents the number of components in the principal name excluding the realm and the pattern for building the name from the sections of the principal name. The base uses $0 to mean the realm, $1 to mean the first component and $2 to mean the second component.

[1:$1@$0] translates "omalley@APACHE.ORG" to "omalley@APACHE.ORG"
[2:$1] translates "omalley/admin@APACHE.ORG" to "omalley"
[2:$1%$2] translates "omalley/admin@APACHE.ORG" to "omalley%admin"

The filter is a regex in parens that must the generated string for the rule to apply.

"(.*%admin)" will take any string that ends in "%admin"
"(.*@ACME.COM)" will take any string that ends in "@ACME.COM"

Finally, the substitution is a sed rule to translate a regex into a fixed string.

"s/@ACME\.COM//" removes the first instance of "@ACME.COM".
"s/@[A-Z]*\.COM//" removes the first instance of "@" followed by a name followed by ".COM".
"s/X/Y/g" replaces all of the "X" in the name with "Y"

So, if your default realm was APACHE.ORG, but you also wanted to take all principals from ACME.COM that had a single component "joe@ACME.COM", you'd do:

RULE:[1:$1@$0](.@ACME.ORG)s/@.//
DEFAULT

To also translate the names with a second component, you'd make the rules:

RULE:[1:$1@$0](.@ACME.ORG)s/@.//
RULE:[2:$1@$0](.@ACME.ORG)s/@.//
DEFAULT

If you want to treat all principals from APACHE.ORG with /admin as "admin", your rules would look like:

RULE[2:$1%$2@$0](.%admin@APACHE.ORG)s/./admin/
DEFAULT
