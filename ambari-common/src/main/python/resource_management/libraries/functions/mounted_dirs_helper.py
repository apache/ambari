  This function determine which dir paths can be created.
  There are 2 uses cases:
  1. Customers that have many dirs, each one on a separate mount point that corresponds to a different drive.
  2. Developers that are using a sandbox VM and all dirs are mounted on the root.

  The goal is to avoid forcefully creating a dir when a user's drive fails. In this scenario, the
  mount point for a dir changes from something like /hadoop/hdfs/data/data1 to /
  If Ambari forcefully creates the directory when it doesn't exist and drive became unmounted, then Ambari will soon
  fill up the root drive, which is bad. Instead, we should not create the directory and let HDFS handle the failure
  based on its tolerance of missing directories.

  This function relies on the history_file parameter to parse a file that contains
  a mapping from a dir, and its last known mount point.
  After determining which dirs can be created if they don't exist, it recalculates the mount points and
  writes to the file again.
