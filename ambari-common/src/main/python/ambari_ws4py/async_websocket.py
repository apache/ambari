WebSocket implementation that relies on two new Python
features:

* asyncio to provide the high-level interface above transports
* yield from to delegate to the reading stream whenever more
  bytes are required

You can use these implementations in that context
and benefit from those features whilst using ws4py.

Strictly speaking this module probably doesn't have to
be called async_websocket but it feels this will be its typical
usage and is probably more readable than
delegated_generator_websocket_on_top_of_asyncio.py
