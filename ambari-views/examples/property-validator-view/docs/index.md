Property Validator View Example
======

Description
-----
The Property Validator View is an example of a basic view that validates configuration parameter values.
It demonstrates the very basics of how to use the Validator.

The view.xml specifies a Validator class to use for property validation. This class is packaged with the view
and implements the [org.apache.ambari.view.validation.Validator](https://github.com/apache/ambari/blob/trunk/ambari-views/src/main/java/org/apache/ambari/view/validation/Validator.java)
interface. When a view instance is created, or updated, the validator class is called where
the view performs any special configuration property validation. The result of that validation is returned as a
[org.apache.ambari.view.validation.ValidationResult](https://github.com/apache/ambari/blob/trunk/ambari-views/src/main/java/org/apache/ambari/view/validation/ValidationResult.java)

    <validator-class>org.apache.ambari.view.property.MyValidator</validator-class>

Package
-----
All views are packaged as a view archive. The view archive contains the configuration
file and various optional components of the view.

##### view.xml

The view.xml file is the only required file for a view archive.  The view.xml is the configuration that describes the view and view instances for Ambari.

Build
-----

The view can be built as a maven project.

    cd ambari-views/examples/property-validator-view
    mvn clean package

The build will produce the view archive.

    target/property-validator-view-0.1.0.jar

Place the view archive on the Ambari Server and restart to deploy.    

    cp property-validator-view-0.1.0.jar /var/lib/ambari-server/resources/views/
    ambari-server restart
    
Create View Instance
-----

With the view deployed, from the Ambari Administration interface,
create an instance of the view (called P_1) to be used by Ambari users.

Access the view service end point:

    /api/v1/views/PROPERTY-VALIDATOR/versions/0.1.0/instances/P_1/resources/properties

Access the view UI:

    /views/PROPERTY-VALIDATOR/0.1.0/P_1
