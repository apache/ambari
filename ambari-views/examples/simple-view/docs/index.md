Simple View Example
======

Description
-----
The Simple View is an example of a basic REST service that serves the configuration parameter value,
and a single HTML page that shows the value. It demonstrates the very basics of how
to write and expose a REST service which works with instance parameters, and the basics of
how to include UI assets with your view that access that service.

Package
-----
All views are packaged as a view archive. The view archive contains the configuration
file and various optional components of the view.

##### view.xml

The view.xml file is the only required file for a view archive.  The view.xml is the configuration that describes the view and view instances for Ambari.
The view.xml for this example defines one required parameter for configuring a view instance: what.is.the.value. The view also
defines a single resource that exposes a REST service at the /simple end point.

    <view>
      <name>SIMPLE</name>
      <label>Simple</label>
      <version>0.1.0</version>
      <parameter>
        <name>what.is.the.value</name>
        <description>Provide a configuration value</description>
        <required>true</required>
      </parameter>
      <resource>
        <name>simple</name>
        <service-class>org.apache.ambari.view.simple.SimpleService</service-class>
      </resource>
    </view>

Build
-----

The view can be built as a maven project.

    cd ambari-views/examples/simple-view
    mvn clean package

The build will produce the view archive.

    ambari-views/examples/simple-view/target/simple-view-0.1.0.jar

Place the view archive on the Ambari Server and restart to deploy.    

    cp simple-view-0.1.0.jar /var/lib/ambari-server/resources/views/
    ambari-server restart
    
Create View Instance
-----

With the view deployed, create an instance of the view to be used by Ambari users.

    POST
    /api/v1/views/SIMPLE/versions/0.1.0/instances/SIMPLE_1
    
    [ {
      "ViewInstanceInfo" : {
        "label" : "Simple 1",
        "description" : "Enter a configuration value",
        "properties" : {
          "what.is.the.value" : "blue"
        }
      }
    } ]

Access the view service end point:

    /api/v1/views/SIMPLE/versions/0.1.0/instances/SIMPLE_1/resources/simple

Access the view UI:

    /views/SIMPLE/0.1.0/SIMPLE_1
