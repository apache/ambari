Calculator View Example
========
Description
-----
The Calculator view is another simple view example.  Like the HelloWorld view example, it demonstrates the basics of how to write and deploy a view in Ambari but also includes a simple resource.  The Calculator resource uses JAX-RS annotations to define the actions that can be performed on the resource.

Package
-----

All views are packaged as a view archive.  The view archive contains the configuration file and various optional components of the view.

##### view.xml

The view.xml file is the only required file for a view archive.  The view.xml is the configuration that describes the view and view instances for Ambari.

      <view>
        <name>CALCULATOR</name>
        <label>The Calculator View</label>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
        <resource>
          <name>calculator</name>
          <service-class>org.apache.ambari.view.proxy.CalculatorResource</service-class>
        </resource>
        <instance>
          <name>INSTANCE_1</name>
        </instance>
      </view>

The configuration in this case defines a view named CALCULATOR that has a single instance.  The view also defines a resource named 'calculator'.



##### CalculatorResource.java

The CalculatorResource class defines the calculator resource for the view.  It uses JAX-RS annotations to define the actions that can be performed on the resource.

      @GET
      @Path("/add/{a}/{b}")
      @Produces({"text/html"})
      public Response add(@PathParam("a") double a, @PathParam("b") double b) {
        String result = a + " + " + b + " = " + (a + b);
        return Response.ok("<b>" + result + "</b>").type("text/html").build();
      }

The add method will service requests to **'calculator/add/{a}/{b}'** for INSTANCE_1 of the CALCULATOR view.  

For example ...

     http://<server>:8080/api/v1/views/CALCULATOR/instances/INSTANCE_1/resources/calculator/add/77.5/87.62


Build
-----

The view can be built as a maven project.

    cd ambari-views/examples/calculator-view
    mvn clean package

The build will produce the view archive.

    ambari-views/examples/calculator-view/target/calculator-view-1.0.0.jar


Deploy
-----
To deploy a view we simply place the view archive in the views folder of the ambari-server machine.  By default the views folder is located at ...

    /var/lib/ambari-server/resources/views

To deploy the Calculator view simply copy the calculator-view jar to the ambari-server views folder and restart the ambari server.

Use
-----

After deploying a view you should see it as a view resource in the Ambari REST API.  If we request all views, we should see the CALCULATOR view.

      {
        "href" : "http://<server>:8080/api/v1/views",
        "items" : [
          {
            "href" : "http://<server>:8080/api/v1/views/CALCULATOR",
            "ViewInfo" : {
              "view_name" : "CALCULATOR"
            }
          },
          {
            "href" : "http://<server>:8080/api/v1/views/HELLO_SERVLET",
            "ViewInfo" : {
              "view_name" : "HELLO_SERVLET"
            }
          },
          {
            "href" : "http://<server>:8080/api/v1/views/HELLO_WORLD",
            "ViewInfo" : {
              "view_name" : "HELLO_WORLD"
            }
          }
        ]
      }


If we want to see the details about a specific view, we can ask for it by name.  This shows us that the CALCULATOR view has a single instance named INSTANCE_1.

      http://<server>:8080/api/v1/views/CALCULATOR/versions/1.0.0

      {
      "href" : "http://<server>:8080/api/v1/views/CALCULATOR/versions/1.0.0",
      "ViewVersionInfo" : {
        "archive" : "/var/lib/ambari-server/resources/views/work/CALCULATOR{1.0.0}",
        "label" : "The Calculator View",
        "parameters" : [ ],
        "version" : "1.0.0",
        "view_name" : "CALCULATOR"
      },
      "instances" : [
        {
          "href" : "http://<server>:8080/api/v1/views/CALCULATOR/versions/1.0.0/instances/INSTANCE_1",
          "ViewInstanceInfo" : {
            "instance_name" : "INSTANCE_1",
            "version" : "1.0.0",
            "view_name" : "CALCULATOR"
          }
        }
      ]
    }

To see a specific instance of a view, we can ask for it by name.  Here we can see the attributes of the view instance.  We can also see that this view has a resource name 'calculator'.

    http://<server>:8080/api/v1/views/CALCULATOR/versions/1.0.0/instances/INSTANCE_1

    {
      "href" : "http://<server>:8080/api/v1/views/CALCULATOR/versions/1.0.0/instances/INSTANCE_1",
      "ViewInstanceInfo" : {
        "context_path" : "/views/CALCULATOR/1.0.0/INSTANCE_1",
        "instance_name" : "INSTANCE_1",
        "version" : "1.0.0",
        "view_name" : "CALCULATOR",
        "instance_data" : { },
        "properties" : { }
      },
      "resources" : [
        {
          "href" : "http://<server>:8080/api/v1/views/CALCULATOR/versions/1.0.0/instances/INSTANCE_1/resources/calculator",
          "instance_name" : "INSTANCE_1",
          "name" : "calculator",
          "version" : "1.0.0",
          "view_name" : "CALCULATOR"
        }
      ]
    }
    
We can access the view's resource through the resource's href.

    http://<server>:8080/api/v1/views/CALCULATOR/versions/1.0.0/instances/INSTANCE_1/resources/calculator/

We can access the add method of the resource with the following â€¦

     http://<server>:8080/api/v1/views/CALCULATOR/versions/1.0.0/instances/INSTANCE_1/resources/calculator/add/77.5/87.62
