      Sets the HAWQ system user (gpadmin) password. This password is used for ssh key exchange when initializing a cluster or provisioning a new host.
      Set when the HAWQ system user is created.
      When changing passwords after initial creation, first update the password directly on the hosts, then enter a new hawq_password value.

    <description>
       Enable/Disable exchanging ssh keys for HAWQ system user (gpadmin) across all HAWQ nodes during start of HAWQ Master. HAWQ system user
       must be able to login to HAWQ nodes using passwordless ssh, else HAWQ operations will fail. SSH keys must be exchanged during installation of
       HAWQ service or when new HAWQ hosts are added. By default, ssh keys are exchanged every time with HAWQ Master start/restart.
       For larger clusters, this may be set to false temporarily to allow faster start time. Valid values are true/false.
