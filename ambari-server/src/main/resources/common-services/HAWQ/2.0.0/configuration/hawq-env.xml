    <description>The password of HAWQ system user.
      During cluster initialization and when provisioning new hosts, ssh keys are exchanged using this password.
      Initially, the HAWQ system user will be created with this password.
      Afterwards, the password should be changed directly on the hosts first and then the updated value must be entered here.
