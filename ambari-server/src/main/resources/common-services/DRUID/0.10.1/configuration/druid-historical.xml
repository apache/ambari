    <description>This specifies a buffer size for the storage of intermediate results. The computation engine in both
      the Historical and Realtime nodes will use a scratch buffer of this size to do all of their intermediate
      computations off-heap. Larger values allow for more aggregations in a single pass over the data while smaller
      values can require more passes depending on the query that is being executed.

    <description>The maximum number of bytes-worth of segments that the node wants assigned to it. This is not a limit
      that Historical nodes actually enforces, just a value published to the Coordinator node so it can plan
      accordingly.

    <description>Historical nodes keep track of the segments they are serving so that when the process is restarted they
      can reload the same segments without waiting for the Coordinator to reassign. This path defines where this
      metadata is kept. Directory will be created if needed.
