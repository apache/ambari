    <description>
      Comma separated AUTHORITY=SPARK_CONF_DIR, where AUTHORITY is the
      HOST:PORT of the ResourceManager of a YARN cluster. The wildcard '*'
      configuration is used when there is no exact match for an authority.
      The SPARK_CONF_DIR contains the relevant spark-defaults.conf properties
      file. If the path is relative is looked within the Oozie configuration
      directory; though the path can be absolute.  This is only used when the
      Spark master is set to either "yarn-client" or "yarn-cluster".
