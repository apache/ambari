    <description>
      This directory is used to temporarily save out-of-order writes before
      writing to HDFS. For each file, the out-of-order writes are dumped after
      they are accumulated to exceed certain threshold (e.g., 1MB) in memory.
      One needs to make sure the directory has enough space.

    <name>nfs.exports.allowed.hosts</name>
    <description>
      By default, the export can be mounted by any client. To better control the access,
      users can update the following property. The value string contains machine name and access privilege,
      separated by whitespace characters. Machine name format can be single host, wildcards, and IPv4
      networks.The access privilege uses rw or ro to specify readwrite or readonly access of the machines
      to exports. If the access privilege is not provided, the default is read-only. Entries are separated
      by &quot;;&quot;. For example: &quot;192.168.0.0/22 rw ; host*.example.com ; host1.test.org ro;&quot;.
