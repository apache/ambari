    <description>
      Ambari Metrics service uses HBase as default storage backend. Set the rootdir for
      HBase to either local filesystem path if using Ambari Metrics in embedded mode or
      to a HDFS dir, example: hdfs://namenode.example.org:9000/hbase.  By
      default HBase writes into /tmp. Change this configuration else all data
      will be lost on machine restart.

    <description>
      Temporary directory on the local filesystem.
      Change this setting to point to a location more permanent
      than '/tmp' (The '/tmp' directory is often cleared on
      machine restart).
