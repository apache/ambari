"""
The naming convention for ServiceAdvisor subclasses depends on whether they are
in common-services or are part of the stack version's services.

In common-services, the naming convention is <service_name><service_version>ServiceAdvisor.
In the stack, the naming convention is <stack_name><stack_version><service_name>ServiceAdvisor.

Unlike the StackAdvisor, the ServiceAdvisor does NOT provide any inheritance.
If you want to use inheritance to augment a previous version of a service's
advisor you can use the following code to dynamically load the previous advisor.
Some changes will be need to provide the correct path and class names.

  SCRIPT_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
  PARENT_DIR = os.path.join(SCRIPT_DIR, '../<old_version>')
  PARENT_FILE = os.path.join(PARENT_DIR, 'service_advisor.py')

  try:
    with open(PARENT_FILE, 'rb') as fp:
      service_advisor = imp.load_module('service_advisor', fp, PARENT_FILE, ('.py', 'rb', imp.PY_SOURCE))
  except Exception as e:
    traceback.print_exc()
    print "Failed to load parent"

  class <NewServiceAdvisorClassName>(service_advisor.<OldServiceAdvisorClassName>)

where the NewServiceAdvisorClassName and OldServiceAdvisorClassName follow the naming
convention listed above.

For examples see: common-services/HAWQ/2.0.0/service_advisor.py
and common-services/PXF/3.0.0/service_advisor.py
