  <!--
  Note: This file includes only those configs which are supposed to have different value from the parent hive/hive-site.
       It inherits the other required configs from hive/hive-site.
       The inheritance logic in order to get hive2/hive-site goes like this :

       1. We read the hive/hive-site which includes the stack defaults and Stack Advisor recommended values.
       2. We take the read hive/hive-site (step 1), and on top of it apply the hive-interactive-site to get
          hive2/hive-site.

       Therefore, any config defined here will override the config value read from hive2/hive-site (step 1).

    <description>Whether to use hybrid grace hash join as the join method for mapjoin.
      Applies to dynamically partitioned joins when running in LLAP, but not to regular
      broadcast(map) joins. hive.llap.enable.grace.join.in.llap is used for this.
