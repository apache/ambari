    <description>
      The ResourceCalculator implementation to be used to compare Resources in the scheduler.
      The default i.e. org.apache.hadoop.yarn.util.resource.DefaultResourseCalculator only uses
      Memory while DominantResourceCalculator uses Dominant-resource to compare multi-dimensional
      resources such as Memory, CPU etc. A Java ResourceCalculator class name is expected.
