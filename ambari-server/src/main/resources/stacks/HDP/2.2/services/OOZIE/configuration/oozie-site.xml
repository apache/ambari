      Comma separated AUTHORITY=HADOOP_CONF_DIR, where AUTHORITY is the HOST:PORT of
      the Hadoop service (JobTracker, HDFS). The wildcard '*' configuration is
      used when there is no exact match for an authority. The HADOOP_CONF_DIR contains
      the relevant Hadoop *-site.xml files. If the path is relative is looked within
      the Oozie configuration directory; though the path can be absolute (i.e. to point
      to Hadoop client conf/ directories in the local filesystem.

    <value>false</value>
    <description>
      When true, Oozie will reject any coordinators with a frequency faster than 5 minutes.  It is not recommended to disable
      this check or submit coordinators with frequencies faster than 5 minutes: doing so can cause unintended behavior and
      additional system stress.
