    <description>The resources in this list will be localized to the node running LaunchMapper and added to HADOOP_CLASSPTH
      before launching 'hive' command.  If the path /foo/bar is a directory, the contents of the the entire dir will be localized
      and ./foo/* will be added to HADOOP_CLASSPATH.  Note that since classpath path processing does not recurse into subdirectories,
      the paths in this property may be overlapping.  In the example above, "./tez-site.xml:./tez-client/*:./lib/*" will be added to
      HADOOP_CLASSPATH.
      This can be used to specify config files, Tez artifacts, etc.  This will be sent -files option of hadoop jar command thus
      each path is interpreted by Generic Option Parser.  It can be local or hdfs path.
