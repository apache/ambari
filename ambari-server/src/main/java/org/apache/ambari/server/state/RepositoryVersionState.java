/**
 * The {@link RepositoryVersionState} represents the state of a repository on a
 * particular host. Because hosts can contain a mixture of components from
 * different repositories, there can be any combination of
 * {@link RepositoryVersionState#CURRENT}} entries for a single host. A host may
 * not have multiple entries for the same repository.
 * <p/>
 *
 *
 * <pre>
 * Step 1: Initial Configuration
 * Version 1 is CURRENT
 *
 * Step 2: Add another repository and trigger distributing repositories/installing packages
 * Version 1: CURRENT
 * Version 2: INSTALLING
 *
 * Step 3: distributing repositories/installing packages action finishes successfully or fails
 * Version 1: CURRENT
 * Version 2: INSTALLED
 *
 * or
 *
 * Version 1: CURRENT
 * Version 2: INSTALL_FAILED (a retry can set this back to INSTALLING)
 *
 * Step 4: Perform an upgrade of every component on the host from version 1 to version 2
 * Version 1: INSTALLED
 * Version 2: CURRENT
 *
 * Step 4a: Perform an upgrade of a single component, leaving other components on the prior version
 * Version 1: CURRENT
 * Version 2: CURRENT
 *
 * Step 4b: May revert to the original version via a downgrade, which is technically still an upgrade to a version
 * and eventually becomes
 *
 * Version 1: CURRENT
 * Version 2: INSTALLED
 *
 * *********************************************
 * Start states: NOT_REQUIRED, INSTALLING, CURRENT
 * Allowed Transitions:
 * INSTALLED -> CURRENT
 * INSTALLING -> INSTALLED | INSTALL_FAILED | OUT_OF_SYNC
 * INSTALLED -> INSTALLED | INSTALLING | OUT_OF_SYNC
 * OUT_OF_SYNC -> INSTALLING
 * INSTALL_FAILED -> INSTALLING
 * CURRENT -> INSTALLED
