# Configuration Group
A Configuration group or Config group is type of resource that supports grouping of configuration resources and host resources for a service.
Host is identified using the registered hostname of the host and the configuration resource is identified by the type and tag.

Example list of all config groups defined for a cluster:

    GET /api/v1/clusters/c1/config_groups
    {
      "href" : "http://your.ambari.server/api/v1/clusters/c1/config_groups",
      "items" : [
        {
          "href" : "http://your.ambari.server/api/v1/clusters/c1/config_groups/2",
          "ConfigGroup" : {
            "cluster_name" : "c1",
            "id" : 2
          }
        }
      ]
    }

### Intuition
Hosts grouped together based on certain similar characteristics will essentially share the same configuration for a Service and its components deployed on those hosts; consequently, different configuration for a different service.

## Management
Get call to view details of a particular config group identified by an :id

    GET /api/v1/clusters/c1/config_groups/:id
    {
      "href" : "http://your.ambari.server/api/v1/clusters/c1/config_groups/:id",
      "ConfigGroup" : {
        "cluster_name" : "c1",
        "description" : "Next Gen Slaves Group",
        "desired_configs" : [
          {
            "tag" : "nextgen1",
            "type" : "core-site",
            "href" : "http://your.ambari.server/api/v1/clusters/c1/configurations?type=core-site&tag=nextgen1"
          }
        ],
        "group_name" : "Test Datanode group",
        "hosts" : [
          {
            "host_name" : "host1",
            "href" : "http://your.ambari.server/api/v1/clusters/c1/hosts/host1"
          }
        ],
        "id" : :id,
        "tag" : "HDFS"
      }
    }

To create a new config group, it is mandatory to provide a config group name, a tag and the cluster name to which it belongs.
The tag as seen in this example is a name of the service. Two config groups with the same tag cannot be associated with the same host.

    POST /api/v1/clusters/c1/config_groups
    [
       {
          "ConfigGroup": {
             "cluster_name": "c1",
             "group_name": "hdfs-nextgenslaves",
             "tag": "HDFS",
             "description": "HDFS configs for rack added on May 19, 2010",
             "hosts": [
                {
                   "host_name": "host1"
                }
             ],
             "desired_configs": [
                {
                   "type": "core-site",
                   "tag": "nextgen1",
                   "properties": {
                      "key": "value"
                   }
                }
             ]
          }
       }
    ]

Notice that the desired_configs specifies the property set for the configuration resource. In this particular case, a new configuration will be created with the type and tag specified and associated with the resulting Config group if the configuration does not exist.
If a configuration with given type and tag exists, the property set would be ignored since a configuration is immutable.

An update on a Config group expects the entire resource definition to be sent with the PUT request.

    PUT /api/v1/clusters/c1/config_groups/2
    [
       {
          "ConfigGroup": {
             "cluster_name": "c1",
             "group_name": "hdfs-nextgenslaves",
             "tag": "HDFS",
             "description": "HDFS configs for rack added on May 19, 2010",
             "hosts": [
                {
                   "host_name": "host1"
                },
                {
                   "host_name": "host2"
                },
                {
                   "host_name": "host3"
                }
             ],
             "desired_configs": [
                {
                   "type": "core-site",
                   "tag": "nextgen1"
                },
                {
                   "type": "hdfs-site",
                   "tag": "nextgen1"
                }
             ]
          }
       }
    ]

A Config group identified by the :id can be deleted.

    DELETE /api/v1/clusters/c1/config_groups/:id
