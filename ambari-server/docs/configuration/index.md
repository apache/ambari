## Introduction
Ambari Server is configured using a flat text properties file. The file is read once when starting Ambari. Any changes made to the properties file are only reflected after restarting Ambari. 

```
/etc/ambari-server/conf/ambari.properties
```

## Database And Persistence
In addition to the static database connection properties, it's possible to supply custom properties for both EclipseLink and the database driver through `ambari.properties`. 

### Database Driver
Using the `server.jdbc.properties.` prefix, it's possible to supply specific properties to the database driver being used by Ambari. These properties do not affect JPA or any of the persistence-unit operations. They are solely to govern the behavior of the database driver. 

```
server.jdbc.properties.lockTimeout=15000
server.jdbc.properties.loginTimeout=15000
```

### Persistence Unit
EclipseLink properties can also be configured using a prefix of `server.persistence.properties.`. The EclipseLink properties should be defined in their entirety with the prefix prepended in front of them.

```
server.persistence.properties.eclipselink.jdbc.batch-writing.size=25
server.persistence.properties.eclipselink.profiler=QueryMonitor
```
