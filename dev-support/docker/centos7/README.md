## Build and install Ambari by dev-support
Dev support is used to quickly develop and test ambari, which runs on the docker containers.

### **Step 1**: Install build tools: Git、Docker
The scripts require docker to be installed, since the compile process will run in a docker container and Ambari cluster also deploys on containers.

**RHEL (CentOS 7) :**
```shell
yum install -y git docker
```
### **Step 2**: Download Ambari source
```shell
git clone https://github.com/apache/ambari.git
```
### **Step 3**: Enter workspace
**RHEL (CentOS 7) :**
```shell
cd ambari/dev-support/docker/centos7/
```
### **Step 4**: Build develop basic image
Run the setup command, you will get `ambari/develop:trunk-centos-7` image. It has the enviroment needed to compile Ambari and run servers such as Ambari Server, Ambari Agent, Mysql, etc.

**RHEL (CentOS 7) :**
```shell
./build-image.sh
```
### **Step 5**: Build Ambari source & create Ambari cluster
* The first compilation will take about 1 hour to download resources, and the next compilation will directly use the maven cache.
* Ambari UI、Ambari Server Debug Port、MariaDB Server are also exposed to local ports: 8080、5005、3306.
* Docker host names are: ambari-server、ambari-agent-01、ambari-agent-02.
* Access admin page via http://localhost:8080 on your web browser. Log in with username `admin` and password `admin`.
* Extra configurations are in `build-containers.sh` last few lines, eg. Kerberos Configuration、Hive DB Configuration.

**RHEL (CentOS 7) :**
```shell
./build-containers.sh
```
### **Step 6**: Re-build Ambari Server
Re-compile Ambari without re-create and deploy clusters.

**RHEL (CentOS 7) :**
```shell
./build-ambari.sh
```

### **Step 7**: Redistribution stack
Re-distribute stack scripts without re-create clusters.

**RHEL (CentOS 7) :**
```shell
./distribute-scripts.sh
```
### **Step 8**: Clean Ambari cluster
Clean up the containers of Ambari cluster when you are done developing or testing.

**RHEL (CentOS 7) :**
```shell
./clear-containers.sh
```
### Step 9: Clean up the build environment
**Note :** This operation will completely delete maven cache.

**RHEL (CentOS 7) :**
```shell
docker rm -f ambari-rpm-build
```
