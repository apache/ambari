Introduction

  The Apache Ambari project is aimed at making Hadoop management simpler by developing software for provisioning, managing, and monitoring Apache Hadoop clusters.
  Ambari provides an intuitive, easy-to-use Hadoop management web UI backed by its RESTful APIs.

  The set of Hadoop components that are currently supported by Ambari includes:

  {{{http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/hdfs} HDFS}},
  {{{http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/mapreduce} MapReduce}}
  {{{http://hive.apache.org} Hive}},
  {{{http://incubator.apache.org/hcatalog} HCatalog}},
  {{{http://hbase.apache.org} HBase}},
  {{{http://zookeeper.apache.org} ZooKeeper}},
  {{{http://incubator.apache.org/oozie/} Oozie}},
  {{{http://pig.apache.org} Pig}},
  {{{http://sqoop.apache.org} Sqoop}}

  []

  Ambari enables System Administrators to:

  * Provision a Hadoop Cluster
  
    * Ambari provides a step-by-step wizard for installing Hadoop services across any number of hosts.
    
    * Ambari handles configuration of Hadoop services for the cluster.

  []

  * Manage a Hadoop Cluster
  
    * Ambari provides central management for starting, stopping, and reconfiguring Hadoop services across the entire cluster.

  []

  * Monitor a Hadoop Cluster
  
    * Ambari provides a dashboard for monitoring health and status of the Hadoop cluster.

    * Ambari leverages {{{http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/} Ganglia}} for metrics collection.

    * Ambari leverages {{{http://www.nagios.org/} Nagios}} for system alerting and will send emails when your attention is needed (e.g., a node goes down, remaining disk space is low, etc).

  []

  Ambari enables Application Developers and System Integrators to:

  * Easily integrate Hadoop provisioning, management, and monitoring capabilities to their own applications with the {{{https://github.com/apache/ambari/blob/trunk/ambari-server/docs/api/v1/index.md} Ambari REST APIs}}.

Getting Started with Ambari

  Follow the {{{./1.2.2/installing-hadoop-using-ambari/content/index.html} installation guide for Ambari 1.2.2}}.

  Note: Ambari currently supports 64-bit RHEL/CentOS 5 + 6 and SLES 11.

Get Involved

  Visit the {{{https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AMBARI/Ambari} Ambari Wiki}} for design documents, roadmap, development guidelines, etc.

  The first {{{http://www.meetup.com/Apache-Ambari-User-Group} Ambari User Group Meetup}} took place on April 2 in Palo Alto, California, USA.  {{{http://www.meetup.com/Apache-Ambari-User-Group/events/109316812/} See the slides and WebEx session from the Meetup}}.  

What's New?

  Check out the work going on for the {{{./whats-new.html} upcoming 1.3.0 release}}.

Disclaimer

  Apache Ambari is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
