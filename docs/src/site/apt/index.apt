Introduction

  The Apache Ambari project is aimed at making Hadoop management simpler by developing software for provisioning, managing, and monitoring Apache Hadoop clusters.
  Ambari provides an intuitive, easy-to-use Hadoop management web UI backed by its RESTful APIs.

  The set of Hadoop components that are currently supported by Ambari includes:

  {{{http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/hdfs} HDFS}},
  {{{http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/mapreduce} MapReduce}},
  {{{http://hive.apache.org} Hive}},
  {{{http://incubator.apache.org/hcatalog} HCatalog}},
  {{{http://hbase.apache.org} HBase}},
  {{{http://zookeeper.apache.org} ZooKeeper}},
  {{{http://incubator.apache.org/oozie/} Oozie}},
  {{{http://pig.apache.org} Pig}},
  {{{http://sqoop.apache.org} Sqoop}}

  []

  Ambari enables System Administrators to:

  * Provision a Hadoop Cluster
  
    * Ambari provides a step-by-step wizard for installing Hadoop services across any number of hosts.
    
    * Ambari handles configuration of Hadoop services for the cluster.

  []

  * Manage a Hadoop Cluster
  
    * Ambari provides central management for starting, stopping, and reconfiguring Hadoop services across the entire cluster.

  []

  * Monitor a Hadoop Cluster
  
    * Ambari provides a dashboard for monitoring health and status of the Hadoop cluster.

    * Ambari leverages {{{http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/} Ganglia}} for metrics collection.

    * Ambari leverages {{{http://www.nagios.org/} Nagios}} for system alerting and will send emails when your attention is needed (e.g., a node goes down, remaining disk space is low, etc).

  []

  Ambari enables Application Developers and System Integrators to:

  * Easily integrate Hadoop provisioning, management, and monitoring capabilities to their own applications with the {{{https://github.com/apache/ambari/blob/trunk/ambari-server/docs/api/v1/index.md} Ambari REST APIs}}.
